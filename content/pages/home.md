# StyleCare — Personalized Fashion for College Students

Hi! Welcome to StyleCare — a personalized fashion platform designed to help college women ages 18–25 shop with confidence.

Meet Sofia: she loves the clean girl look — minimal silhouettes, neutral palettes, and elevated basics — but she’s overwhelmed by options. She wants an effortless, polished wardrobe but struggles to find affordable pieces that work together and to style them without looking like she’s trying too hard.

StyleCare centers the clean girl aesthetic and makes it achievable for college students. We combine educational guides, curated capsule collections, and influencer matches focused on neutral, timeless outfits so users spend less time scrolling and more time wearing what feels right.

How StyleCare helps Sofia (and you):

- Fast style quiz that identifies your clean girl sub-style (e.g., casual-minimal, elevated basics, monochrome) and matches you with budget-friendly stores.
- Capsule collections built around neutral palettes: blazers, slim jeans, white tees, knitwear, loafers — items that mix-and-match effortlessly.
- Influencer matches who actually shop the clean girl aesthetic at student prices, so inspiration is realistic.
- Practical guides: capsule wardrobe building, outfit formulas (e.g., blazer + tee + straight jeans), care tips, and simple skincare/routine suggestions to complete the look.
- Seamless shopping via partner links and post-purchase styling tips to help you put outfits together and feel confident.

Customer journey — a clean girl flow:

- Awareness: Discover StyleCare via social or influencer collab showcasing clean girl outfits.
- Consideration: Take the quiz, explore curated capsules, and read short guides that teach outfit-making step-by-step.
- Conversion: Buy curated bundles or individual basics through partner links with student-friendly offers.
- Post-purchase: Receive easy styling tips, outfit suggestions, and community prompts to share your looks.

Why niche matters: focusing on the clean girl aesthetic lets us curate smarter — fewer, better pieces that create dozens of outfits, not a closet full of confusion. For college women, that means saving money, wasting less, and wearing more of what they love.
